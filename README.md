Automate Code Deployment Using CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

Learned the CI/CD workflow. Added a Python file, Dockerfile, and requirements file in Eclipse. 
Placed the workflow YAML in the GitHub main branch. Created a Docker Hub account and added a GitHub secret.
Committed and pushed the files; the pipeline ran and the image was uploaded to Docker Hub. 
Verified the changes locally by running the Docker container and checking localhost.
